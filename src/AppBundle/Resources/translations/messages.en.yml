  welcome: Hello everybody
  part1: |
        First of all, let me introduce myself: my name is Terry ROMEU and I am in the third year
        of the IT School INGÃ‰SUP in Bordeaux.
        This is a little website made with Symfony3 in a school project context.
        You'll be able to see my
  part2: , my several
  part3: , and a little
  part4: >
        On this website, you'll have a fully access to the pages mentionned above, post comments,
        log in to have a beautiful avatar, and, if you're lucky enough to be an admin, you'll can
        edit directly the content of the website, users, and moderate the comments.
  part5: >
        To make everything possible, I had to use the following bundles - FOSUserBundle, Sonata Admin Bundle,
        JMSI18nRoutingBundle.
  part6: >
        I would like to apologize but the entire website will not be available in English because of a
        lack of time.
        Enjoy the discovery!
